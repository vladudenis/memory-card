# Memory Card Game 

## Description

A memory card game where you must click on each card once and only once until every single one of them has been clicked. 

## Goals

I'm going to use League of Legends champions on my cards because Pokemons seem to clich√©. I plan on creating multiple levels with increasing difficulty, which -- considering the number of them -- is an additional reason I chose League of Legends champions. I'm also going to add Score label that keeps track of the current score, as well as a Highscore label for the highest score achieved.

Another goal I want to complete with this project is the creation of a light/dark mode toggle button. Having learned a lot about the styled-components library, I'm also going to make as much use of it as possible.
